# Third-party notices

The Altinity® SQL Browser is licensed under Apache-2.0 (see `LICENSE`). The built
single-file artifact (`dist/sql.html`) inlines the runtime dependencies below
(CodeMirror 6 ships as several packages) plus small validator helpers generated
from Ajv and `fast-deep-equal`; this file reproduces their MIT
license texts as required, and the same notices are embedded as a comment at
the top of the built artifact.
