-- shop — a tiny demo schema that EXISTS to show the data-flow graph:
-- a raw events table feeding 3 materialized views into aggregate targets,
-- a dictionary sourced from a dimension table, and a view on an aggregate.
-- Generated data is intentionally small (50 products, 20k events).
--
-- On a replicated antalya cluster, wrap each statement in ON CLUSTER '{cluster}'
-- and use Replicated* engines so every replica has it; shown single-node here.
-- After loading, the demo user needs read access for the graph to draw fully:
--   GRANT SELECT ON system.dictionaries TO demo;   -- else no dict edges (Code 497)
--   GRANT SELECT ON shop.* TO demo;
