## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Playwright e2e now runs on **WebKit** in addition to Chromium and Firefox, so
  many Safari regressions on the `html{zoom}`-based layout fail CI instead of
  shipping silently. README gained a **Supported browsers** stance: desktop
  Chromium/Firefox/Safari are supported; the full browser/ClickHouse/IdP matrix
  is tracked in #71. (#69)
- `tests/e2e/zoom-support.spec.js` regression-guards the fullscreen-panel sizing
  mechanism (#70) on all three engines. Caveat now documented: Playwright's WebKit
  is **not** a faithful Safari proxy for `zoom` × `getBoundingClientRect`/viewport
  units — it behaves like Chromium there — so that path is verified manually (#71).

### Changed
- State reactivity now uses `@preact/signals-core` (the third bundled runtime
  dependency), adopted incrementally per
  [ADR-0001](docs/ADR-0001-reactivity.md): the tab list, side panel, run state
  (`running`/`resultView`), the library title, and now the **schema panel**
  (`schema`/`schemaError`/`schemaFilter`) repaint via signal `effect`s instead of
  manual render calls. No user-facing behavior change. A Preact schema-panel spike
  was evaluated and **rejected** — the app stays framework-free (ADR-0001
  addendum); the schema slice is the documented imperative exception, converted
  with a *replaced* Set-valued `expanded` signal and reference-replaced column
  loads rather than in-place mutation. This **completes the migration**. (#88, #91)

### Fixed
- The fullscreen schema / EXPLAIN graph panels were mis-sized on **Safari** (#70).
  They size off viewport units, and engines disagree on how `vw`/`vh` interact
  with `html{zoom}`: Chromium's ignore `zoom` (so `100vh` overshoots one screen by
  the zoom factor and must be divided back), but WebKit/Safari's track `zoom`, so
  the existing `calc(.../var(--zoom))` correction shrank those panels to ~83%. The
  divisor is now measured at runtime (a `100vh` probe vs the one-screen `#root`)
  and published as `--vp-zoom` — ~`--zoom` on Chromium, ~1 on Safari — so the
  panels fit exactly one screen on both. The rest of the UI was already correct on
  Safari (its pointer/caret/drag corrections self-calibrate to the live rect
  ratio). A `@supports not (zoom: 1)` rule still neutralizes the factor to 1 on
  engines that can't parse `zoom` at all.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- `SECURITY.md`: private vulnerability-disclosure policy + the `config.json`
  threat model (it's served to browsers — prefer a PKCE public client; lock the
  redirect URI if a `client_secret` is unavoidable) and the CSP/token baseline (#72).
- In-app build stamp: the build bakes `v<version> (<short-commit>)` into
  `dist/sql.html` (graceful `v<version>` fallback when not a git checkout) and
  shows it in the user menu, so a bug report can be tied to an exact build (#74).
- `NOTICE` + `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, and the bundled Chart.js / dagre (MIT)
  notices are now embedded in the built `dist/sql.html`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and this `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Dependabot configuration for npm + GitHub Actions updates.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- Schema detail pane: removed the "Insert SHOW CREATE" action button; opening a
  node now rings its card (a double border) and the ring clears on every
  pane-close path including Esc (#65).
- Code-review follow-ups for the schema/zoom work: extracted `schemaLayout()` and
  a `fixedAnchor()` helper, and the transitive-lineage node cap now counts only
  linked nodes so a large single database isn't truncated early (#64).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- Whole-database schema graph now draws **every** table (linked or not), packs the
  unlinked tables into a grid below the lineage, and drops the redundant `<db>.`
  prefix from node labels for objects in the focused database (#63).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Bridged the shipped `html { zoom }` across the full-view schema panel and the
  splitter / detail-pane-resize / popover coordinate math, so the full view fits
  one screen (the detail-pane DDL was previously pushed off-screen) and drags and
  popovers track the cursor (#62).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- `antalya-oauth` demo connection (Google SSO).

### Changed
- Documentation updates; dropped the inaccurate "zero-dependency" framing (the
  app bundles two deliberate runtime dependencies).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Initial release: OAuth-gated (PKCE) single-file SQL browser served from
  ClickHouse — SQL editor, sortable results table + chart view, EXPLAIN pipeline
  graph, and the schema data-flow graph. Built by esbuild into one `dist/sql.html`.
