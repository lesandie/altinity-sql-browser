# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

GitHub Releases (cut from `v*` tags by `.github/workflows/release.yml`) carry the
auto-generated per-PR notes; this file is the curated, human-readable history.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Playwright e2e now runs on **WebKit** in addition to Chromium and Firefox, so
  Safari regressions on the `html{zoom}`-based layout fail CI instead of
  shipping silently. README gained a **Supported browsers** stance: desktop
  Chromium/Firefox/Safari are supported (Safari verified green on CI); the full
  browser/ClickHouse/IdP matrix is tracked in #71. (#69)

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- `SECURITY.md`: private vulnerability-disclosure policy + the `config.json`
  threat model (it's served to browsers — prefer a PKCE public client; lock the
  redirect URI if a `client_secret` is unavoidable) and the CSP/token baseline (#72).
- In-app build stamp: the build bakes `v<version> (<short-commit>)` into
  `dist/sql.html` (graceful `v<version>` fallback when not a git checkout) and
  shows it in the user menu, so a bug report can be tied to an exact build (#74).
- `NOTICE` + `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, and the bundled Chart.js / dagre (MIT)
  notices are now embedded in the built `dist/sql.html`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and this `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Dependabot configuration for npm + GitHub Actions updates.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- Schema detail pane: removed the "Insert SHOW CREATE" action button; opening a
  node now rings its card (a double border) and the ring clears on every
  pane-close path including Esc (#65).
- Code-review follow-ups for the schema/zoom work: extracted `schemaLayout()` and
  a `fixedAnchor()` helper, and the transitive-lineage node cap now counts only
  linked nodes so a large single database isn't truncated early (#64).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- Whole-database schema graph now draws **every** table (linked or not), packs the
  unlinked tables into a grid below the lineage, and drops the redundant `<db>.`
  prefix from node labels for objects in the focused database (#63).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Bridged the shipped `html { zoom }` across the full-view schema panel and the
  splitter / detail-pane-resize / popover coordinate math, so the full view fits
  one screen (the detail-pane DDL was previously pushed off-screen) and drags and
  popovers track the cursor (#62).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- `antalya-oauth` demo connection (Google SSO).

### Changed
- Documentation updates; dropped the inaccurate "zero-dependency" framing (the
  app bundles two deliberate runtime dependencies).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Initial release: OAuth-gated (PKCE) single-file SQL browser served from
  ClickHouse — SQL editor, sortable results table + chart view, EXPLAIN pipeline
  graph, and the schema data-flow graph. Built by esbuild into one `dist/sql.html`.
