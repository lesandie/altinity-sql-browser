# ADR-0001: Reactivity — incremental signals, not a framework

- **Status:** Accepted — adopted on `spike/signals-core` (#88)
- **Date:** 2026-06-29 (adopted 2026-06-30)
- **Context tracking:** roadmap #68; adoption #88
- **Evidence:** `spike/signals` (hand-rolled primitive + two converted slices),
  `spike/signals-core` (the chosen primitive; tabs/sidePanel, then the
  `resultView`+`running` and `libraryName`+`libraryDirty` scalar slices)

## Context

The app is a framework-free ES-module SPA: pure logic in `src/core/` (100%
covered), an injected-seam controller (`createApp(env)`), and a hand-rolled
hyperscript render layer in `src/ui/`. As feature count grows (16+ open issues),
the recurring pain is **manual render invalidation**: state is mutated and then
the dependent views are repainted by hand (e.g. `tabs.js`'s old `refresh()`
called `renderTabs` + editorSync + `renderResults` + `updateSaveBtn`). Forgetting
a dependent → stale UI. This is an *absence-of-reactivity* problem, distinct from
a *component-model* problem.

Three hard constraints frame any solution: a single self-contained HTML artifact
with zero third-party requests (CLAUDE.md rule 4 — deliberate deps only), the
per-file 100/100/100/100 coverage gate (rule 1), and the injected-seam layering
(rule 2).

## Decision

Adopt **`@preact/signals-core`** (`signal()` / `effect()` / `computed()` /
`batch()` / `untracked()`) and migrate state **one slice at a time**, reading
and writing through `.value`. An accessor helper (like `activeTab()`) is
*optional* — used where it usefully contains reader churn, skipped where the
churn is trivially mechanical (see the Consequences guideline). **Do not** adopt
a UI framework (React/Preact/Solid).

A hand-rolled ~70-line primitive was prototyped first and works (`spike/signals`),
but `@preact/signals-core` was chosen over it: same `.value` API (so the
migration code is identical and the choice is reversible in ~5 lines), but
maintained, glitch-free (correct topological/diamond updates), and with a lazy
memoized `computed()` — none of which the naive synchronous prototype provides.
It costs one small, zero-transitive-dependency package and **+1.4 KB gzip** to
the artifact (vs +0.45 KB hand-rolled), in exchange for not owning ~70 lines +
~180 test lines of correctness-critical reactive code. Per CLAUDE.md rule 4 this
is a deliberate dependency; it is still inlined, so the artifact makes zero
third-party requests.

## Options considered (all measured)

| Option | artifact Δ (gzip) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **@preact/signals-core** | **+1.4 KB** | **Chosen** — maintained, glitch-free, `computed`; same `.value` API; we own no reactive code |
| Hand-rolled `signal.js` | +0.45 KB | Viable (`spike/signals`) — zero deps, but we own + 100%-cover it; naive (not glitch-free), no `computed` |
| Preact + @preact/signals | +7.3 KB (`spike/preact`) | Rejected — its only edge over signals-core is auto DOM-diffing of large lists, which we don't need |
| Solid.js | ~+7 KB | Rejected — compiler/plugin + ecosystem cost; same unneeded big-list benefit |
| React (proper) | ~+45 KB | Rejected — heaviest dep, vDOM-on-big-tables liability, mismatch with the single-file ethos |

Decisive factor: we do **not** need a virtualized / large-list renderer (no
10k-row grid requirement), which is the one thing a vDOM framework buys over a
bare signals core. The pain is invalidation, which signals solve directly — and
between the two signals options, a maintained, glitch-free core beats owning the
primitive for ~1 KB.

## Evidence (spike)

Two slices converted end-to-end with the full suite + per-file coverage gate
green and a real `npm run build` (1033 tests on the hand-rolled branch; 1022 on
`spike/signals-core`, which drops the 11 primitive-internal tests):

- **tabs** (`tabs` + `activeTabId`) — *has* an `activeTab()` accessor → 16 callers
  insulated; low mechanical churn, but one behavioral test relocation (the
  repaint responsibility moved from `tabs.js` to a `createApp()` effect).
- **sidePanel** — *no* accessor → every reader changed, but the churn was purely
  mechanical `.value` and concentrated in the panel's own test file; no assertion
  rewrites.

Both branches share the slice conversions verbatim. Moving from the hand-rolled
primitive to `@preact/signals-core` was a 5-line diff (import swaps + deleting
`src/core/signal.js` and its test), demonstrating the API parity and that the
choice is reversible.

## Consequences

- Mutating a converted slice is just `state.x.value = …`; an `effect()` repaints.
  Manual `refresh()` lists are deleted.
- **Migration is monotonic**: a slice keeps some direct render calls until its
  co-dependent slices are also signals. No slice un-converts another.
- Per-slice cost is mostly mechanical `.value` edits in that slice's tests.
- **Guideline (not a rule):** add an accessor helper (like `activeTab()`) for a
  slice with many scattered readers to contain churn; slices with few or
  localized readers convert fine with bare `.value`. Validated by the
  `sidePanel` slice (no helper — "worst case") and the `resultView`/`running`
  and `libraryName`/`libraryDirty` scalar slices, all helper-free.
- Adding `@preact/signals-core` makes **three** bundled runtime deps. On adoption
  the dependency count was updated in CLAUDE.md rule 4, THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md,
  and `build/build.mjs` comments (all done).
- Re-evaluate Preact/Solid only if the UI later grows many interdependent
  components with rich local state, or a genuine large-list render need appears.

## Addendum — Preact spike on the schema panel (#88, branch `spike/preact-schema`)

The scalar slices (`resultView`/`running`, `libraryName`/`libraryDirty`) fit
signals-core cleanly. The **schema panel** does not: `state.schema` was a nested
array mutated *in place* (`db.expanded`, an `expandedTables` Set, `tb.columns`
flipping null→'loading'→array), and signals only react to reference changes — so
a signals-core conversion would just relocate the manual-invalidation pain into
`schema.value = [...]` bumps. That makes it the fair test of whether a
component+vDOM model earns adoption. We built it as Preact components
(`SchemaTree → DbRow → TableRow → ColumnRow`) to gather evidence — explicitly
re-opening this ADR's "no framework" line for *complex panels only*.

**What the spike proved (the thesis holds):**
- The in-place-mutation anti-pattern is **gone**. Per-row expand state and lazy
  columns are component-local `useState`; the `expandedTables` Set and
  `db.expanded` were deleted; `loadColumns` became `fetchColumns` (returns the
  columns for local state, still caches to `tb.columns` for autocomplete — a data
  cache now decoupled from rendering). `state.schema`/`schemaError`/`schemaFilter`
  are signals the tree reads via `@preact/signals` auto-tracking; no manual
  `renderSchema()` calls remain.
- **The 100/100/100/100 per-file coverage gate is achievable** on the component
  file (`src/ui/schema.js`) with tests ported to preact's `render` + `act()`.
- Signal→component auto-tracking works under happy-dom (load and filter repaint
  the mounted tree).

**What it cost (measured / observed):**
- **Bundle: +6.8 KB gzip** (148,044 → 154,873 B; raw 457,892 → 474,440) — close
  to this ADR's +5.9 KB estimate. ~+4.6% of the artifact, still zero third-party
  requests (inlined).
- **A second paradigm.** signals-core `effect()`s drive the rest of `createApp`
  (tabs/results/title); the schema tree is Preact. Two render models coexist —
  the main ongoing cost.
- **Integration seams with the imperative layer:** `Icon.*()` returns live SVG
  DOM nodes that Preact can't embed, so a `ref`-mounter bridges them; preact's
  `h` vs the project's hand-rolled `h`; `loadColumns` had to be reshaped.
- **Test friction:** scenarios staged by poking global state (`expandedTables`,
  `tb.columns`) now require driving interactions; every interaction needs `act()`;
  the double-click detector forced a fake-timer gap between open/collapse clicks.
  Coverage still reaches 100%, but assertions shifted from state to DOM/behaviour.
- **LOC:** `src/ui/schema.js` 149 → 185 (+36), plus `preact` + `@preact/signals`
  deps (would make **five** bundled runtime deps; CLAUDE.md rule 4 +
  THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES would need updating *iff* adopted — not done on the spike).
- Used preact's `h()` (zero build/test config); JSX would improve ergonomics
  further but needs esbuild + vitest jsx config — not required to evaluate the
  component model.

**Recommendation: do not adopt Preact now; stay signals-core.** The component
model genuinely removes the anti-pattern and is fully testable, but the costs
(a second render paradigm app-wide, +6.8 KB, the icon/`h`/columns integration
seams) are paid across the whole app to benefit **one** panel. That matches this
ADR's original reasoning — the need is invalidation, not a component model, and
there is no large-list requirement. Keep the schema panel as a **documented
imperative exception** (or, if its `tb.columns`/expand churn becomes a real
maintenance drag, convert it with signals-core using *replaced* Set/Map-valued
signals rather than in-place mutation). The `spike/preact-schema` branch stands
as the evidence; re-open the decision only when several complex, interdependent,
rich-local-state panels are actually on the roadmap (per the trigger above).

## Addendum — schema slice landed via signals-core (#91, completes #88)

The schema slice was converted with signals-core exactly as the fallback above
prescribed — **no Preact**. `schema`/`schemaError`/`schemaFilter` are now
`signal(...)`; the in-place anti-pattern is gone two ways: per-row expand state
moved from the mutated `db.expanded` bool + `expandedTables` Set into a single
**Set-valued `expanded` signal** (keys `db:`/`tb:`), updated copy-on-write; and
lazy column loads **replace the `schema` reference** (`{...tb, columns}`) instead
of mutating `tb.columns` in place — `tb.columns` stays the completion cache
`buildCompletions` reads, so `completions.js` was untouched (lower churn than a
separate Map-valued signal; the gate held). Two `effect()`s in `createApp`
(schema tree + error banner) replaced every scattered `renderSchema()` call; the
expand+first-fetch is wrapped in `batch()` so the row opens with its spinner in
one repaint. This was the last slice — **#88 is complete**. The
re-evaluation trigger in #91 still applies: if reference-replacement proves as
forgettable as the old manual `renderSchema` calls, revisit via a fresh ADR.

## Addendum — three session-only UI flags converted (#102)

`state.shortcutsOpen`, `state.editingSavedId`, and `state.bannerDismissedFor`
(previously bare fields — the latter two lived on `app` directly, not
`app.state`) were converted to `signal(...)` and consolidated into `state.js`
alongside the other session-only, non-persisted fields (`libraryFilter`,
`resultSort`). None had a reactive reader before or after — each site that sets
one already calls its own repaint (`renderSavedHistory`, `updateBanner`,
`openShortcuts`'s own mount/unmount) — so this is a pure `.value` mechanical
edit, not a new `effect()`. Housing them in `state.js` rather than on `app`
matches every other slice in this file; #88's "last slice" note above refers to
the schema panel specifically, not every remaining plain field in the
codebase — this is a smaller, unrelated follow-up tidying three of those.
